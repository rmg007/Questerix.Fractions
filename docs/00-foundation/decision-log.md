# Decision Log

Append-only record of every notable planning decision. Once a decision is here, it's the answer until explicitly revised in a new entry.

Format:

- **Date** of decision
- **Decision ID** (`D-NN`) for cross-reference
- **What was decided**
- **Why** (the reasoning, not just the outcome)
- **Alternatives considered** (briefly)
- **Source** (which docs reflect this decision)

Decisions are ordered chronologically. **Newest at the top.**

---

## D-23 — 2026-04-30 — Ratification of 9-KC Consolidation Taxonomy

**Decision:** The curriculum's Knowledge Component (KC) taxonomy is consolidated from 33 skills (`SK-NN`) to 9 high-level KCs: `KC-HALVES-VIS`, `KC-UNITS-VIS`, `KC-SET-MODEL`, `KC-PRODUCTION-1`, `KC-PRODUCTION-2`, `KC-SYMBOL-BASIC`, `KC-SYMBOL-ADV`, `KC-MAGNITUDE`, and `KC-ORDERING`.

**Why:** 33 KCs were too granular for effective BKT convergence during short student pilots. Consolidation provides ~31 templates per KC, ensuring stable mastery estimates faster.

**Alternatives:** 12-KC model. Rejected as still too fragmented for 15-minute sessions.

**Source:** `AUDIT_REPORT_A5.md`, `PLANS/curriculum-update.md`

---

## D-22 — 2026-04-30 — Parity Contract: Items, Misconceptions, and Hints

**Decision:** A strict "Parity Contract" is enforced. Every Item Template must target a specific KC and optionally "bait" a specific Misconception. Every detected Misconception must have a corresponding Hint ladder.

**Why:** Prevents "diagnostic black holes" where students fail but the system doesn't know why, or knows why but has no specific remediation.

**Alternatives:** Ad-hoc authoring. Rejected as non-scalable for educational validation.

**Source:** `PLANS/curriculum-update.md §2.2`

---

## D-21 — 2026-04-30 — Adoption of Multi-Phase Curriculum Update Plan

**Decision:** The project officially adopts the 8-phase curriculum update plan (`PLANS/curriculum-update.md`) as the master roadmap for Phase 1 completion.

**Why:** Solidifies the pedagogical foundation (CPA, Equal-Sharing) and aligns the content pipeline with research-grounded standards.

**Alternatives:** Iterative "next-bug" approach. Rejected for lack of systemic rigor.

**Source:** `PLANS/curriculum-update.md`


## D-20 — 2026-04-24 — Content-pipeline retry budget standardized to 3 retries

**Decision:** The content-pipeline generation loop retries failed LLM calls up to **3 times** before aborting and surfacing an error. No other retry count is valid.

**Why:** Fewer retries (1–2) caused intermittent pipeline failures on transient API errors; more than 3 inflated cost without improving success rates in practice. (audit §2.6)

**Alternatives:** Per-stage configurable retries. Rejected — extra configuration surface with no benefit for a solo pipeline.

**Source:** `30-architecture/content-pipeline.md`

---

## D-19 — 2026-04-24 — Hint.type pruned to 3-tier ladder

**Decision:** `Hint.type` is restricted to the values `verbal | visual_overlay | worked_example`. All other candidate types (animated, socratic, peer-example) are removed.

**Why:** A clean 3-tier escalation ladder (verbal → overlay → worked example) is easier to author, easier to test, and matches the interaction model spec. More tiers add authoring cost without evidence of learning benefit. (audit §2.1)

**Alternatives:** 5-tier ladder. Rejected — overfitting to edge cases not observed in K–2 use.

**Source:** `30-architecture/data-schema.md`, `20-mechanic/interaction-model.md`

---

## D-18 — 2026-04-24 — Set-halving (G4.5) cut from L4

**Decision:** The set-halving goal G4.5 is removed from the Level 4 spec. Set-fraction activities are out of MVP scope.

**Why:** `10-curriculum/misconceptions.md` M8 already declares set-fraction activities out of MVP scope. Including G4.5 in L4 contradicted that declaration and risked introducing a mechanic that would need its own validator and archetype. (audit §1.6)

**Alternatives:** Keep G4.5 with a deferred implementation note. Rejected — a goal without an implementation path is noise in the level spec.

**Source:** `10-curriculum/levels/level-04.md`, `10-curriculum/misconceptions.md`

---

## D-17 — 2026-04-24 — Mechanic and QuestionType collapsed into `archetype`

**Decision:** The terms `Mechanic` and `QuestionType` are deprecated synonyms. The single canonical term is **`archetype`**, with values matching `20-mechanic/activity-archetypes.md`. Any code or doc using `mechanic` or `questionType` as an enum name must be updated to `archetype`. (audit §1.5)

**Alternatives:** Keep `Mechanic` as the primary term. Rejected — `archetype` is already used in the file name, validator IDs, and scene naming; collapsing reduces term count.

**Source:** `00-foundation/glossary.md`, `20-mechanic/activity-archetypes.md`, `30-architecture/data-schema.md`

---

## D-16 — 2026-04-24 — Skill IDs consolidated into single registry

**Decision:** All Skill IDs (`SK-NN`) are defined once in `docs/10-curriculum/skills.md`. Per-level files reference skill IDs but do not redefine them.

**Why:** Collisions across level files caused `SkillMastery` overwrite risk — two level docs redefining the same `SK-NN` with different BKT parameters could silently corrupt mastery tracking. A single registry prevents that. (audit §1.1)

**Alternatives:** Each level doc owns its skill definitions. Rejected — the collision risk is not hypothetical; it was observed in the audit.

**Source:** `10-curriculum/skills.md`, per-level specs

---

## D-15 — 2026-04-24 — Misconception ID `MC-PRX-01` is canonical

**Decision:** All references to "Proximity-to-1 confusion" use `MC-PRX-01`. The variant `MC-PROX-01` is invalid and was corrected in `level-08.md` and `level-09.md`.

**Why:** Concise IDs (3-letter family code) are easier to read in JSON dumps and align with the `MC-WHB`, `MC-EOL`, `MC-MAG` conventions already established in `misconceptions.md`.

**Alternatives:** Keep both with one as alias. Rejected — silent aliases create confusion in cross-reference audits.

**Source:** `10-curriculum/misconceptions.md`, `levels/level-08.md`, `levels/level-09.md`

---

## D-14 — 2026-04-24 — Content pipeline lives outside `src/`

**Decision:** The content authoring tool lives in `tools/content-pipeline/`, not `src/`. It's Python (or TypeScript), produces a static JSON seed file at `src/assets/curriculum/v{n}.json`, and never runs in the production app.

**Why:** Build tools and runtime code have different lifecycles, dependencies, and security profiles. Mixing them inflates the production bundle.

**Alternatives:** Inline TS pipeline that runs from npm scripts. Rejected — Python's data/ETL ecosystem is denser, and the seed JSON is the only handoff needed.

**Source:** `30-architecture/content-pipeline.md §6`

---

## D-13 — 2026-04-24 — Programmatic verification replaces LLM accuracy review

**Decision:** Generated `QuestionTemplate` records are verified by Python clones of the runtime validators, not by LLM "accuracy reviewer" agents.

**Why:** K–2 fraction math is finitely verifiable. `1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4` is a one-line check. An LLM reviewer is slower, more expensive, and _less_ reliable than executable code.

**Alternatives:** 3-agent reviewer team from the inherited LangGraph plan. Rejected — over-engineering for trivially-verifiable content.

**Source:** `30-architecture/content-pipeline.md §4`

---

## D-12 — 2026-04-24 — Models for content pipeline: Haiku 4.5 + Sonnet 4.6

**Decision:** Generation uses Claude Haiku 4.5; editorial polish uses Claude Sonnet 4.6.

**Why:** Haiku 4.5 is fast and cheap for templated structured output. Sonnet 4.6 is better at nuanced kid-language phrasing. Total cost ~$3–8 per full curriculum pack regeneration.

**Alternatives:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Oct 2024) from inherited plan. Rejected — two model generations old, ~10× cost for the same output.

**Source:** `30-architecture/content-pipeline.md §6.3`

---

## D-11 — 2026-04-24 — Inherited LangGraph plan does not fit; new content-pipeline.md replaces it

**Decision:** The plan in `c:\dev\Test_LangGraph\` is rejected as a direct fit. A Questerix-specific replacement (`docs/30-architecture/content-pipeline.md`) is now the source of truth.

**Why:** Inherited plan generates explanation+MCQ-quiz format; Questerix needs typed `QuestionTemplate` records (placement, comparison, ordering, partition, etc.). Adapting the inherited plan would require replacing ~80% of it. Cleaner to design from the schema outward.

**Alternatives:** Adapt the LangGraph plan in place. Rejected — would inherit the wrong abstractions.

**Source:** `30-architecture/content-pipeline.md §14`

---

## D-10 — 2026-04-24 — `_quarantine/` for now; permanent delete deferred

**Decision:** All deprecated docs (PRODUCT_AUDIT, RoadMap folders 04 & 05, enterprise template files) are moved to `_quarantine/`, not deleted. Permanent delete happens at end of Phase 1.

**Why:** Quarantine is reversible during the foundation-docs review window. If a doc is found to contain salvageable content during cross-reference, it can be restored without git history archaeology.

**Alternatives:** Delete immediately. Rejected — destructive `rm` was blocked by permission system, and moving is safer regardless.

**Source:** `_quarantine/` folder, decision-log entry D-10

---

## D-09 — 2026-04-24 — C8 rewritten as two-axis progression

**Decision:** Constraint C8 (Linear Denominator Progression) is rewritten to specify a two-axis progression: **denominator family × verb**.

- L1–L2: halves only, identify-axis
- L3: thirds + fourths added, still identify-axis
- L4: make halves (verb axis advances)
- L5: make thirds + fourths
- L6+: comparison/ordering, denominator linearity relaxed

**Why:** Original C8 wording was denominator-only and conflicted with `level-03.md` (which introduces fourths) and `level-04.md` (which advances the verb). Two-axis better captures the actual pedagogical structure.

**Alternatives:** Keep one-axis C8 and rewrite all level docs. Rejected — level docs follow established pedagogical sequence; constraint is what should bend.

**Source:** `00-foundation/constraints.md` change log entry 2026-04-24

---

## D-08 — 2026-04-24 — Foundation docs precede code

**Decision:** No new code in `src/` until the `/docs` foundation suite (28 documents) is complete and reviewed.

**Why:** The unanswered questions are pedagogical, not technical. Writing more code before the docs are settled risks throwing away working code when the docs lock in.

**Alternatives:** Build Level 1 in parallel with finalizing docs. Rejected by user direction ("we are far far from coding").

**Source:** `00-foundation/vision.md`, `50-roadmap/mvp-l1-l9.md` Phase 0

---

## D-07 — 2026-04-24 — Storage: Dexie.js on IndexedDB + PWA + persist + JSON export

**Decision:** Persistence stack:

- **Dexie.js v4** wrapping IndexedDB (~22 KB gzipped)
- App ships as installable **PWA** with valid manifest
- App calls `navigator.storage.persist()` after first engagement
- "Backup my progress" button exports IndexedDB → downloadable JSON file

**Why:** localStorage cannot hold the schema. SQLite WASM is overkill (400 KB–1 MB bundle for capabilities we don't need). PGLite is wildly overkill (3 MB). iOS Safari ITP evicts non-PWA storage after 7 days of non-use, so PWA install + persist() is mandatory.

**Alternatives:** localStorage (rejected — too small, evicted), SQLite WASM (rejected — bundle bloat), PGLite (rejected — overkill).

**Source:** `30-architecture/persistence-spec.md`

---

## D-06 — 2026-04-24 — One app, lazy-loaded levels, not 5 separate apps

**Decision:** Levels 1–9 ship in one app bundle; level assets are loaded on demand. No separate apps per grade.

**Why:** Unified UX, shared code, single update surface. Code duplication and fragmented analytics are the bigger costs.

**Alternatives:** Five separate apps per grade band. Rejected — 5× maintenance cost, fragmented user experience.

**Source:** Conversation history; `30-architecture/runtime-architecture.md`

---

## D-05 — 2026-04-24 — User-facing terminology: "Levels" not "Grades"

**Decision:** Student-facing UI says "Level 1, Level 2, ..." not "Grade K, Grade 1." Internal docs may use either when clarifying mapping.

**Why:** "Level" is age-agnostic and game-native; "Grade" carries school baggage and stigma. A 7-year-old playing Level 2 doesn't feel held back; a 7-year-old playing "Grade K" might.

**Alternatives:** Both visible. Rejected — adds vocabulary load without value.

**Source:** `00-foundation/glossary.md`, conversation history

---

## D-04 — 2026-04-24 — Visual style: simple + bright (deprecate neon sci-fi)

**Decision:** Flat design, primary colors, sans-serif (Lexend 400/600, with Nunito 400/700 as fallback). The original neon "Cosmic Blue + Cyan/Pink" theme in `src/data/config.ts` is deprecated.

**Why:** Validation needs the mechanic to be testable, not stylish. K–2 students parse simple shapes faster; A/B testing pedagogy without aesthetic confounds is more reliable.

**Alternatives:** Keep neon aesthetic. Rejected — adds cognitive load without learning gain; conflicts with reduced-motion accessibility.

**Source:** Constraint C6, `20-mechanic/design-language.md`

---

## D-03 — 2026-04-24 — MVP scope: Levels 1–9 only

**Decision:** MVP covers Levels 1–9 (Grade K through Grade 2 fraction concepts). Levels 10+ (Grade 3 operations, Grade 4 reduction, Grade 5 decimals) are post-MVP-2029.

**Why:** Levels 1–5 build the partition+identify+make schema. Levels 6–9 prove that schema teaches _magnitude_ (the only outcome that matters). Operations are a different mechanic and a different validation question.

**Alternatives:** L1–L5 only (faster) or L1–L15 (broader). Rejected — L1–L9 is the smallest scope that proves the mechanic actually teaches.

**Source:** Constraint C3, `00-foundation/vision.md`, `10-curriculum/scope-and-sequence.md`

---

## D-02 — 2026-04-24 — No teacher / parent / admin surface until 2029

**Decision:** MVP has one persona: the student. No teacher dashboard, parent reports, class management, or admin tools before 2029-01-01.

**Why:** Triples surface area without contributing to the core validation question. Teachers and parents may use the app informally during MVP.

**Alternatives:** Lightweight teacher-only surface. Rejected — even "lightweight" requires accounts, which require backend, which requires C1 to be relaxed.

**Source:** Constraint C2, `50-roadmap/post-mvp-2029.md`

---

## D-01 — 2026-04-24 — No backend until 2029

**Decision:** App runs entirely client-side. No servers, no APIs, no authentication, no database hosting until 2029-01-01.

**Why:** Hosting cost, maintenance burden, security review, privacy compliance all out of scope until pedagogical validation passes. The validation question doesn't require a backend to answer.

**Alternatives:** Cheap free-tier backend (Supabase, Firebase) for MVP. Rejected — even free tiers add account/privacy/auth complexity that distracts from validation.

**Source:** Constraint C1, `30-architecture/persistence-spec.md`

## How New Decisions Get Added

1. New decision is made (in conversation, in a doc, or in review).
2. Append a new entry at the top of this list with the next `D-NN` ID.
3. Update the source doc(s) with the resolution.
4. If the decision resolves an entry in `open-questions.md`, remove it from there.

Decisions are not deleted; they are superseded. If a decision is reversed later, write a new entry citing the old one as the prior decision being overturned.
