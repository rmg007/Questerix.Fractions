# Questerix Fractions — Architecture Review

**Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Branch:** `main` | **Reviewer:** AI Agent  
**Scope:** Full technical audit — engine, persistence, scenes, curriculum, audio, accessibility, deployment

---

## Executive Summary

The visual design, SettingsScene, and persistence layer (Dexie v3 + all 17 repositories) are solid and working. The gameplay loop is critically broken: BUG-01 serves the wrong archetype prompt, BUG-02 means validation never passes, BKT mastery tracking is never called, and Levels 2–9 are structurally inaccessible from the UI. The immediate action is Sprint 0: fix BUG-01 first (a 10-minute filter change), then debug BUG-02 with real-browser console logging — these two bugs block every downstream gate. Overall status: Sprint 0 of 5; the app is not ready for a student today.

## 2. The Five Readiness Dimensions

```
1. Gameplay Loop       — Can a student complete a session?
2. Learning Engine     — Does the app actually learn about the student?
3. Content & Levels    — Are questions accessible, authored, and routing correctly?
4. Student Experience  — Is the UX clear and fair?
5. Operational         — Can it be deployed, tested, and maintained?
```

## 3. Dimension 1 — Gameplay Loop

### Status: 🔴 BROKEN — Session completion currently unreachable

#### BUG-01: Wrong prompt text — archetype mismatch in template filter

`Level01Scene` loads templates by level number but does not filter by archetype. The first template returned happens to be an `identify` question ("Which shape has 1/3 shaded?"). The scene runs the `partition` drag mechanic. Instruction and interaction are incompatible.

|              | Value                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Student sees | "Which shape has 1/3 shaded?"                                       |
| Scene runs   | Rectangle + drag-line to split in half                              |
| Wrong on     | Archetype (identify ≠ partition), fraction (1/3 ≠ 1/2), action verb |
| Fix          | Filter `templatePool` to `archetype === 'partition'` only           |
| Effort       | 2 minutes                                                           |

#### BUG-02: Validation never passes

Even when the drag-line is centered, "Check ✓" always returns wrong. Student stuck at 0/5.

| Hypothesis                                           | Test                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `handlePos` not updated on drag events               | `console.log(handlePos)` in `onSubmit`          |
| Snap tolerance too tight (5% of width)               | Temporarily widen `SNAP_PCT` to 0.15            |
| Pointer coordinates in screen-space not canvas-space | Check Phaser `Pointer.x` vs raw `event.clientX` |

#### BUG-04: Hint tiers don't advance past Tier 1

The hint button shows Tier 1 on every press. `HintLadder.next()` is called — needs to be verified it advances state.

#### BUG-05: Settings button routes to SettingsScene correctly (via `scene.launch`)

> **Correction from previous report:** The settings gear correctly calls `this.scene.launch('SettingsScene')`. The earlier QA finding of BUG-05 was likely an environment artifact from the IDE preview. **Retest in real browser to confirm.**

## 4. Dimension 2 — Learning Engine

### Status: 🟡 BUILT, NOT WIRED — Zero student intelligence visible

The user feedback: **"it didn't look very smart."** This is the direct consequence of the learning engine being completely disconnected from gameplay. Every student answer goes into a void.

### What's built but silent

**BKT Mastery Tracking** (`src/engine/bkt.ts`) — production-quality:

- Full Corbett & Anderson 1994 two-pass update
- `deriveState()` → `NOT_STARTED → LEARNING → APPROACHING → MASTERED`
- Mastery threshold: `p ≥ 0.85` + `consecutiveCorrect ≥ 3`
- **Never called. Zero mastery records written.**

**Misconception Detectors** (`src/engine/misconceptionDetectors.ts`):

| Detector      | What it catches                                          | Level       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `detectEOL01` | Equal-parts loose interpretation                         | L1          |
| `detectWHB01` | Whole-number bias — bigger numerator = bigger fraction   | L6+         |
| `detectWHB02` | Whole-number bias — bigger denominator = bigger fraction | L7+         |
| `detectMAG01` | Magnitude blindness                                      | L8+         |
| `detectPRX01` | Proximity-to-1 confusion                                 | L8+         |
| `detectNOM01` | Nominalism                                               | Future stub |
| `detectORD01` | Ordering without magnitude                               | Future stub |

`runAllDetectors()` is exported and ready. **Never called.**

**Hint Event Recording** — `hintEventRepo.record()` is actually called in `LevelScene` (discovered in code review). However `hintsUsedIds: []` is hardcoded in `recordAttempt()` — the hint and attempt records are not linked.

**BKT in LevelScene** — `LevelScene.recordAttempt()` calls `runAllDetectors()` (✅ wired), but does **not** call `updateMastery()` or write to `skillMasteryRepo`. Half-wired.

### What "smart" looks like when fully wired

A student who consistently places the divider slightly right of center should eventually see:

1. Detector flags `EOL-01` (equal-parts loose interpretation)
2. Hint ladder escalates to Tier 2 (visual midpoint overlay) automatically
3. BKT mastery stays in `LEARNING` state — level doesn't advance prematurely
4. After 3 consecutive correct answers without hints, state moves to `APPROACHING`

None of this is visible today because BKT is never called.

### Learning Engine Gates

| Gate | Requirement                                                  | Status                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| G-E1 | `SkillMastery` record updated after every attempt            | ❌ Not called anywhere                         |
| G-E2 | Misconception flags written when pattern detected            | ✅ Wired in LevelScene, ❌ not in Level01Scene |
| G-E3 | Hint events linked to attempt records                        | ⚠️ Events recorded; link missing               |
| G-E4 | Session `accuracy` and `avgResponseMs` are real values       | ❌ Hardcoded to 1 and null                     |
| G-E5 | BKT state transitions visible in IndexedDB after 5 questions | ❌ Blocked by G-E1                             |

## 5. Dimension 3 — Content & Level Access

### Status: 🔴 CRITICAL — Level 2–9 are structurally inaccessible

### 5.1 What the Menu Actually Is

The adventure map has **exactly 3 tappable stations**:

| Station            | Action                     | Visible when                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Play! (amber)      | → `Level01Scene`           | Always                         |
| Continue (emerald) | → `Level01Scene` (resume)  | Only if `lastStudentId` is set |
| Settings (gear)    | → `SettingsScene.launch()` | Always                         |

**There is no way to navigate to Level 2–9 from the UI.** The adventure path and level badges are decorative. A student who masters Level 1 has nowhere to go. This is the direct cause of "couldn't go till the last level."

### 5.2 Level Content Status

| Level         | Archetype(s)            | Templates        | Accessible from UI          |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| L1 — Halves   | `partition`, `identify` | ✅ Seeded        | ✅ Play! button             |
| L2 — Quarters | `partition`, `identify` | ⚠️ Skeleton only | ❌ No route                 |
| L3            | `equal_or_not`, `label` | ❌ Not authored  | ❌ No route                 |
| L4            | `make`                  | ❌ Not authored  | ❌ No route                 |
| L5            | `snap_match`            | ❌ Not authored  | ❌ No route                 |
| L6            | `compare`               | ❌ Not authored  | ❌ No route (TestHook only) |
| L7            | `compare` (harder)      | ❌ Not authored  | ❌ No route (TestHook only) |
| L8            | `benchmark`             | ❌ Not authored  | ❌ No route                 |
| L9            | `order`                 | ❌ Not authored  | ❌ No route                 |

### 5.3 LevelScene Infrastructure Is Ready

`LevelScene.ts` is a **fully capable generic scene**. It receives `{ levelNumber: 1..9 }`, loads templates from Dexie, routes to the correct interaction class (`getInteractionForArchetype()`), runs hints, handles commit/submit, records attempts. All 10 interaction classes exist.

The only missing pieces are:

1. **UI routing** — the menu has no level-select or mastery-gated unlock
2. **Content** — templates for L2–L9 not authored
3. **BKT wiring** — same gap as L1 (`updateMastery` not called)

### Content & Level Access Gates

| Gate | Requirement                                         | Status              |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| G-C1 | L1 template pool filtered to correct archetype      | ❌ BUG-01           |
| G-C2 | L1 has ≥ 10 unique partition templates              | ✅ Seeded           |
| G-C3 | Level 2 is reachable from the menu                  | ❌ No UI route      |
| G-C4 | Level unlock progresses based on mastery            | ❌ No unlock system |
| G-C5 | L2 has authored templates                           | ⚠️ Skeleton only    |
| G-C6 | L3–L9 have authored templates                       | ❌ Not authored     |
| G-C7 | "Keep going" after L1 session complete routes to L2 | ❌ Loops back to L1 |

## 6. Dimension 4 — Student Experience

### Status: 🟡 VISUAL FOUNDATION STRONG — UX loop incomplete

> **Scope change:** Multi-student / parental view is **parked** for a future milestone. Removed from active gaps.  
> **Scope change:** Onboarding is **not a priority** for MVP. Removed.

### 6.1 Feedback Quality — Not Yet Verified

From code review, `LevelScene` and `Level01Scene` implement:

- `EXACT` → green fill animation + "Correct! Great work."
- `CLOSE` → amber animation + "Almost! Try a tiny adjustment."
- `WRONG` → shake + "Not quite — try again."

This code path has **never been reached** in live testing because BUG-02 blocks it. The emotional quality of feedback for a 5–7 year old is unknown.

### 6.2 Session Complete Screen — Not Yet Tested

`showSessionComplete()` renders:

- "🎉 Session complete!" card (sky-blue + navy)
- "You finished N problems!"
- "Keep going ▶" (amber action button)
- "Back to menu" (secondary button)

**Known issue in this screen:** "Keep going ▶" calls `loadQuestion(questionIndex + 1)` — this loops within Level 1 indefinitely, incrementing question index, not advancing to Level 2.

### 6.3 TTS — Built, Not Activated

`TTSService` (Web Speech API, K–2 optimised rate 0.95x) exists. `PreferenceToggle` for "TTS Enabled" in SettingsScene works. **TTS is never called to read prompts aloud.** For K–2 students who are still developing reading skills, hearing the question is critical.

### 6.4 SettingsScene — Fully Implemented

All 393 lines confirmed working: Reduced Motion, TTS Enabled, Storage Permission, Export Backup, Reset Device (with 2-step confirm), Privacy Notice link, Escape key. Accessible via settings gear (`scene.launch('SettingsScene')`).

## 10. What "Done" Looks Like (Classroom Pilot)

A student opens the app, completes Level 1 (5 questions), is told they've mastered halves, unlocks Level 2, plays through all 9 levels over multiple sessions, and the system adjusts difficulty based on their actual performance.

Current state: **Sprint 0 of 5. 1/9 levels accessible. 0/5 learning engine wired.**
